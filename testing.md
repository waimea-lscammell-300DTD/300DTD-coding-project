## Game Description

You are a new mercenary joining the tf2 cast, start off by meeting the amazing scout
and get to know the other mercenaries along the way, beware what choice you choose
if you choose wrong you may pay the price. Successfully meet all of the mercs without angering
which could lead to your death.

The following game features / functionality and player actions will need to be tested:

- UI Setup / The whole UI showing up correctly/playing the game to see if the buttons go in the right spot
- Choosing an choice and checking to see if the right sound plays / Sounds playing when you make a choice/ Go through the game and test
all of the buttons and check if their sound works.
- Testing if the denial, death and meet counters work like they should / death,denial and meet counters / test all of the different outcomes and see if the code is working right
- FUNCTIONALITY / FEATURE / ACTION TO TEST

The following tests will be run against the completed game. The tests should result in the expected outcomes shown.
